grit
===

grit is a small grid/grisu test framework which kicks of bunches of tests at a time. The tests can either be written in either Groovy or Java and are configured using a groovy config file in order to make the whole thing more flexible.

Prerequisites
--------------------

In order to build Grisu from the git sources, you need: 

- Sun Java Development Kit (version â‰¥ 6)
- [git](http://git-scm.com) 
- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) (version >=2)

Download
----------

A pre-build binary of Grit can be found here:

https://code.ceres.auckland.ac.nz/jenkins/job/Grit-SNAPSHOT/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/grit-binary.jar

Checking out sourcecode
-------------------------------------

 `git clone git://github.com/grisu/grit.git`

Building grit using Maven
------------------------------------------

To build one of the above modules, cd into the module root directory of the module to build and execute: 

    cd grit
    mvn clean install
    
This will give you an executable jar file called "grit-binary.jar" in the target directory. In order to run, there also needs to be the bouncy-castle library jar (http://code.ceres.auckland.ac.nz/webstart/bcprov-jdk16-145.jar -- rename to bcprov.jar) in the same folder as grit-binary.jar...

Running grit
--------------------

`java -jar grit-binary.jar -b dev <test-config-files>`

The -b option specifies the backend to connect to. Options at the moment are "bestgrid", "bestgrid-test", "dev", "local".

Tests
---------

You can either write your own tests (implement the [Test interface](https://github.com/grisu/grit/blob/develop/src/main/groovy/grisu/tests/tests/Test.groovy) -- better to just extend [AbstractTest] (https://github.com/grisu/grit/blob/develop/src/main/groovy/grisu/tests/tests/AbstractTest.groovy) though), along with an implementation of a [TestRun](https://github.com/grisu/grit/blob/develop/src/main/groovy/grisu/tests/testRuns/TestRun.groovy) -- again, there's an [AbstractTestRun](https://github.com/grisu/grit/blob/develop/src/main/groovy/grisu/tests/testRuns/AbstractTestRun.groovy) ready to be extended.

Also, existing TestRuns and Tests can be found [here](https://github.com/grisu/grit/tree/develop/src/main/groovy/grisu/tests/testRuns) and [here](https://github.com/grisu/grit/tree/develop/src/main/groovy/grisu/tests/tests).

Template config files can be found [here](https://github.com/grisu/grit/tree/develop/test-templates) and need to be valid groovy files (for more info on that: http://groovy.codehaus.org/ConfigSlurper
